                        <p>Valley First Credit union started out as a fraternal organization formed in 1947 in Penticton, B.C. After years of growth and community partnerships, Valley First merged with Envision Financial in 2011 and became a division of First West Credit Union, British Columbia’s third-largest credit union. Their service oriented structure provides endless support and options for members to help with their financial needs. Committed to making a difference in their community, Valley First supports a number of local organizations focused around causes like literacy, environmental sustainability and education.  Their sense of community is fostered through supporting ongoing traditions like the Penticton Peach Festival and family music events in local parks. In addition to this, Valley First’s signature cause, hunger awareness, is promoted through their program Feed the Valley, an initiative aiming to raise awareness and money for local food banks. Since its inception in 2010, they have raised almost $1,000,000 and 60,000 pounds of food. A big supporter of continuing education, Valley First grants a number of scholarships to local students who have proven through academics and volunteerism their dedication to community investment. Around $27,000 in awards are given out every year in hopes of bettering the recipient’s future and contribution to society. On top of their already generous efforts, Valley First donated a $1,000,000 endowment to the First West foundation, the charitable arm of the credit union, donating a portion of its profits annually.  Valley First continues to make a difference in the communities they serve.
